# Dyakonov-Shur-Instability
Reference [1] reports hydrodynamic electrons subject to unusual *Dyakonov - Shur Boundary Conditions* act as a coherent, nonlinear oscillator in the Terahertz range.  The code in this repository tries to replicate and extend some of their results.  The simulation uses a finite volume method.

## rectangular-geometry
This folder has a python notebook that solves the equation from [1] in an infinite rectangular channel.  This reproduces the results of [1].

## annular-geometry
This folder has some scripts and notebooks that explore the Dyakonov-Shur instability in an annular geometry.  This folder is a work in progress.
