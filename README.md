# Dyakonov-Shur-Instability
Reference [1] reports hydrodynamic electrons subject to unusual *Dyakonov - Shur Boundary Conditions* act as a coherent, nonlinear oscillator in the Terahertz range.  The code in this repository tries to replicate and extend some of their results.  The simulation uses a finite volume method.

## rectangular-geometry
This folder has a python notebook that solves the equation from [1] in an infinite rectangular channel.  This reproduces the results of [1].

## corbino-geometry
This folder has some scripts and notebooks that explore the Dyakonov-Shur instability in an annular geometry.  This folder is a work in progress. I kept all my reports and slides over the course of the project, but a lot of these are incorrect as we come to understand the problem better.  Still, I think it's better to keep them all around for posterity.
