abstract = {Compressible electron flow through a narrow cavity is theoretically unstable, and the oscillations occurring during the instability have been proposed as a method of generating Terahertz radiation. We numerically demonstrate that the endpoint of this instability is a nonlinear hydrodynamic oscillator, consisting of an alternating shock wave and rarefaction-like relaxation flowing back and forth in the device. This qualitative physics is robust to cavity inhomogeneity and changes in the equation of state of the fluid. We discuss the frequency and amplitude dependence of the emitted radiation on physical parameters (viscosity, momentum relaxation rate, and bias current) beyond linear response theory, providing clear predictions for future experiments.},

abstract = {We demonstrate that electrons in a ballistic field effect transistor behave as a fluid similar to shallow water. Phenomena similar to wave and soliton propagation, hydraulic jump, and others should take place in this electron fluid. We show that a relatively slow electron flow should be unstable because of plasma wave amplification due to the reflection from the device boundaries. This provides a new mechanism for the generation of tunable far infrared electromagnetic radiation. {\textcopyright} 1993 The American Physical Society.},
